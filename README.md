This project is a responsive landing page for a fictional medical spa, designed to showcase CSS animations and responsiveness using media queries. The page aims to be visually appealing and provide a seamless experience across various device sizes.

## Reason for Choosing a Medical Spa
I chose to create a landing page for a medical spa because my mom owns one. This project allows me to practice creating content that could be useful for her business in the future. 

## CSS Styling and Animations
- **Color Scheme**: The color scheme consists of various shades of pink and white, creating a femine theme that works well for the target audience which is women..
